The two games I will be comparing are Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike 2. These two games are both first-person shooters. Each game has teams that are working together to complete a goal. Team Fortress 2 has players attempting to capture objectives like control points or payloads, while the other team is trying to defend against the attacking team until the time runs out. There are other game modes like King of the Hill where each team is just trying to capture the center point for 3 minutes. There are no attacking/defending teams in that game mode. Counter-Strike 2 has one main game mode. In its main game mode, one team (the terrorists) is trying to plant a bomb or kill the counter-terrorists. The counter-terrorists are trying to either kill all the terrorists, defuse the bomb, or wait out the time limit. Both games have different opportunities for the player to succeed. Team Fortress 2 has nine classes for players to choose from. Each class has a different strategy. For example, there's the scout who is really fast with average weapons, the heavy who is really slow but has a very powerful weapon, or the medic who heals their allies with a medi-gun. Furthermore, each class has different weapons side-grades they can use instead of their default weapons. Counter-Strike 2 doesn't have different classes. Instead, it has a money system that allows the player to buy a variety of weapons. The better a player is doing, the better weapons they can buy. This allows for the player to try out different weapons based on the game or their interests, which means more strategy. But, if a player dies, they lose any weapons they had and have to buy a new set. Both games have a similar structure, but they each play very differently from one-another.
